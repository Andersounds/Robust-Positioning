The scene is generated by reading the anchor file and adding 0.5m to x and y coordinates
x direction (short side) of scene is defined as 4m to fit everything
With resolution 2560x1600 and 1600 dim is 4 meter gives a 2560 length of 6.4m

anchors are 4X4_50 dictionary


settings are not set


    K(0,0) = 607;
    K(1,1) = 607;
    K(0,2) = 320;
    K(1,2) = 240;   
    warper.setBaseSceneWidth(4);    //Scenewidth is 4m
    float offsetX = 0.5;
    float offsetY = 0.5;


From 5-okt uses this base scene other has the other one that is not completely correct?

NOTE! Scene was created with the anchor locations as in data collection in lund. i.e. marker 0 at x=0,y=0. Scene has hardcoded that all x and y coordinates are added 0.5m to be able to see the whole markers along edges. The anchors.txt file in this directory has adapted locations
