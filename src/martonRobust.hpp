/*
    This class implements a version of the robust trilateration method presented by L Marton et al (isbn: 9781509025916)
    Adaptation is done to fit the use of angulation instead of lateration
    Adaptions include:
        - Angulation to visible anchor point is used together with a separate height estimation
            to find expression for possible circle in 3d
        - The final position estimation is used together with initial angulation data to estimate yaw angle
